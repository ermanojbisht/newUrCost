  Key Stages and Outcomes:

   1. Table Migration Review:
       * `skeleton`: Migrated successfully, conversion_plan.md updated.
       * `languages`: Deemed unnecessary, removed from conversion_plan.md.
       * `units`: Migration corrected for language_id discrepancy.
       * `items`: Documentation clarified (item.md).
       * `rate_card_groups`: Deemed unnecessary, removed from conversion_plan.md.
       * `files`: Significant discrepancies noted; documentation prioritized for now.
       * `truck_speeds`: Missing primary key (id) added to migration.
       * Other tables: sors, job_groups, unit_groups, overhead_master, region_indexings, man_mule_cart_rules, resources, resource_capacity_rules, rates, labor_indices,
         machine_indices, lead_distances, pol_skeletons, pol_rates, subitem_dependencies, subitem_rates, nested_table_items, item_rates, oheads were reviewed, with most
         being in line or having minor discrepancies.

   2. Documentation Management:
       * A new file, documentation/tables_summary.md, was created to centralize table migration status, including old/new names, documentation paths, and issues.
       * Sections for "Tables to be removed" and "Tables to Added as Laravel default" were moved from conversion_plan.md to tables_summary.md as new rows within the table.

   3. Data Migration (Seeding):
       * `sors`: SorSeeder.php created. Initial failure due to users foreign key constraint.
       * `users`: UserSeeder.php created to address sors dependency.
       * `units`: UnitSeeder.php created. Initial failure due to conversion_factor precision; migration updated to decimal(15,4).
       * Seeder Idempotency: SorSeeder.php and UnitSeeder.php modified to skip existing rows.
       * `items`: ItemSeeder.php created.
           * Resolved "Numeric value out of range" for parent_id (-1 converted to null).
           * Resolved "Column 'name' cannot be null" (default 'Unnamed Item' provided).
           * Resolved "Duplicate entry '0' for key 'items.items_item_code_unique'" (unique `item_code` generated).
           * Resolved "foreign key constraint fails (items_unit_id_foreign)" (0 converted to null).
           * Resolved "foreign key constraint fails (items_parent_id_foreign)" (foreign key checks temporarily disabled/re-enabled).



are u continiously updating table order .if not then reorder as per your learning . Always follow rules laid down in @migration_learning.md and @documentation/conversion_plan.md. plz read it again. Complete migration of all table. First check how many migration done then take another table from list . first reorder table list in @documentation/conversion_plan.md 


ok now let's fetch data from old db to new
make seeder in a way

As we have maping of table and field of each table listed as Migration Summary](./tables_summary.md)
and documention and mapping of fileds from old to new system is already saved in documentation file mentioned in this table Migration Summary](./tables_summary.md)
so migration of data can be done through sql between two db tables.

if a row already exist as per primary key then skip that row for effcient system .
iFirst short the source table order with relevent fields then do process (as an idea )
you may temporarily disable foreign key checks before data insertion and re-enable them afterward,

'users','sors' ,'units', 'items' dataseeding is done

now start with 'subitems','rate_cards','truck_speeds','overhead_master','region_indexing'  table
reload memory specially conversion_plan.md




//
resCapacityGrId field in old resources table not used . only one place for view . so i m just taking it in new db . i think it is some kind of grouping
