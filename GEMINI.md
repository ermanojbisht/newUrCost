# urCost Laravel Conversion

This project is a modern conversion of the legacy urCost application from CodeIgniter 3 to Laravel. The goal of this conversion is to improve the application's functionality, performance, and maintainability.

## Legacy Project

The legacy CodeIgniter 3 application is located at `/var/www`. All of the original source code and documentation can be found in that directory.

## Documentation

A complete set of documentation for the legacy application can be found in the `documentation` directory of the legacy project. This documentation includes:

*   [Core Concepts](../documentation/index.md)
*   [Application Architecture](../documentation/index.md)
*   [File-wise Documentation](../documentation/index.md)
*   [Database Schema](../documentation/database.md)
*   [Controller-Model and Model-Table Relationships](../documentation/relationships.md)
*   [Helpers](../documentation/helpers.md)
*   [Libraries](../html_urCost/documentation/libraries.md)

## Conversion Plan

The detailed plan for the conversion can be found in the [Conversion Plan](../documentation/conversion_plan.md) document in the legacy project.

## Migration Learning

During the migration process, any issues encountered and the lessons learned from them will be documented in `migration_learning.md`. This file will serve as a continuous learning log, detailing what went wrong, why it happened, and what steps should be taken to prevent similar failures in the future. This ensures that each iteration of the migration process builds upon previous experiences, leading to a more efficient and successful conversion.
